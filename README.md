Internship Project
 - MAJOR PROJECT

- Business Logic:
      -A few years ago, not many companies were aware of the need for Ethical hacking/penetration
       testing. With the increase in cybercrimes, nowadays, most of the companies have their focus on
       data security. Apart from developers and testers, the companies are now looking for ethical
       hackers or are giving their network/data security as a contract to other ethical hacking
       companies, who would perform penetration testing and other methods to protect and secure
       their data.
 - Consideration:
      -You are hired as a penetration tester in a company. You have been asked to secure their
        network, systems, employee mobiles, etc. To accomplish this, it is also important for you to
        determine the network's existing phase and understand the awareness of cybersecurity
        amongst the employees. To determine this, you need to perform phishing attacks on
        employees and gather all the necessary information. Later with this, you create awareness
        amongst the employee about the data-stealing that has taken place and how important it is to
        secure their network.
        
  - Now once you understood that the network is insecure and may have a lot of loopholes. You
    decide to test the network completely (systems, websites, and mobile phones). To do so, you
    perform penetration testing and find the vulnerabilities on the host's systems that are live and
    running.

  - After determining the loopholes, you need to create a detailed analysis report and share it with
    the concerned department to fix them.

  - Steps to Perform:
    To determine the awareness amongst the employee, you must perform a phishing attack on
    them. As a part of a phishing attack, host a login page and send it to all the employees such that
    it seems original, and if anyone logs in to the website, you can gather their login credentials.
    To accomplish this, follow the tasks given below:
    
    -Host a server and scan the network using various tools and commands.
      ● To determine the live system, to which you will be sharing the login phishing website,
        use the Advanced IP Scanner to scan the LAN network and find the systems connected
        to the same network. Also, determine their IP Address, System names, and MAC
        address.
      ● Use the WAMP server to convert a normal system to a server and host a login phishing
        website, using which you can capture the user credentials (Any website as per your
        wish)
